#### Introduction

Photoify is an assignment for the Yrgo WU18 class where I had to create a responsive Instagram-clone website where users can create accounts and upload their pictures to their profile page.

#### Features

- Follow other Users
- Comment on posts
- Like and dislike posts
- Customize your profile avatar and banner
- Account deletion

### Build Process

The site is made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. <br>At first PHP backend was used directly on the front end. I later on made an API which dynamically fetches post content, user information and comment information in JSON format which JavaScript handles. All data is stored in a database file which is communicated to using SQL.
