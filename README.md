#### Introduction

Photoify is an assignment for the Yrgo WU18 class where I had to create a responsive Instagram-clone website where users can create accounts and upload their pictures to their profile page.

#### Features

- Follow other Users
- Comment on posts
- Like and dislike posts
- Customize your profile avatar and banner
- Account deletion

### Build Process

The site is made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. At first PHP backend was intertwined with the front end. I later on made an API which dynamically fetches post content, user information and comment information. All data is stored in a database file which is communicated to with SQL.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gsvendsen/photoify.git
```

2. Set up a dedicated webserver with the document root as the cloned repository
